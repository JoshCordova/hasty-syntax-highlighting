# Hasty Syntax Highlighting

## Project description
We made a VS Code extension that provides syntax highlighting for the Hasty language. This relates to compilers because it relied on our understanding of the Hasty language grammar, and how to tokenize it. The content of the project is related to the front of the compiler, but we relied on our knowledge of the AST for Hasty in order to better segment our syntax element groups. We benefited from this work by learning new API's and a new style of program analysis (rote regular expression matching).
